              Kratos begins as a Spartan warrior driven by survival and
              conquest. In God of War, Ares deceives him into killing his own
              family, then binds their ashes to his skin as a permanent mark of
              guilt. Kratos serves the Olympian gods to erase his nightmares,
              yet they deny him peace. Rage becomes his identity, and vengeance
              becomes his purpose. He rises from mortal soldier to the new God
              of War through sheer brutality and refusal to submit.

              Past
            </h3>
            <p class="text-justify p-3">
              His past unfolds as a long war against Olympus itself. Betrayal by
              Zeus pushes him into open rebellion, leading to the destruction of
              gods, titans, and much of Greece. Every victory deepens the cycle
              of violence rather than ending it. When he arrives in the Norse
              lands years later, he lives in isolation with his son Atreus and
              hides his divine nature. In God of War Ragnarök, he confronts the
              consequences of his old life while trying to raise a child who
              will not repeat his mistakes. He shifts from a figure of wrath
              into a guarded father who teaches restraint, discipline, and
              responsibility.

            <p class="text-justify p-3">
              In the present, Kratos lives as a restrained and disciplined
              warrior who prioritizes fatherhood over battle. He controls his
              anger instead of letting it control him, choosing patience,
              caution, and protection in place of reckless violence. His
              guidance of Atreus focuses on responsibility, empathy, and self
              control, reflecting lessons learned from the devastation he once
              caused. Though he remains capable of immense destruction, he
              fights only when necessary and carries the weight of every life he
              has taken. This version of Kratos stands as a man trying to live
              honorably while accepting that his past will always follow him.
