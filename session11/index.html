          Tarzan stands as the ultimate bridge between the primeval and the
          aristocratic, a character defined by the "noble savage" archetype.
          Born into British nobility as John Clayton but forged by the harsh
          realities of the African jungle, he embodies a unique fusion of raw
          physical instinct and high-level intellect. While he possesses the
          predatory grace and strength of the Great Apes who raised him, he
          remains an outlier in both worlds—too human for the wild and too
          untamed for the "civilized" drawing rooms of London. This duality
          makes him a deeply introspective figure who often views human society
          through a lens of skepticism, preferring the honesty of nature over
          the perceived hypocrisy of modern man. Ultimately, Tarzan is a
          survivor whose true strength lies not just in his muscles, but in his
          unyielding moral code and his perpetual search for a place to truly
          belong.

              Origins: In 1888, John and Alice Clayton are marooned on the West
              African coast after a mutiny. Following their deaths, their infant
              son is adopted by Kala, a female of a fictional ape species known
              as the Mangani.

              Youth: Named Tarzan ("White-Skin"), the boy develops extraordinary
              physical strength and agility. He discovers his parents' abandoned
              cabin and, using their books, teaches himself to read and write
              English, though he cannot yet speak it.

              The Dilemma: Tarzan eventually travels to the West to find Jane.
              While he discovers he is the rightful heir to the Greystoke
              estate, he initially conceals his identity to ensure Jane's
              financial security when he finds she is engaged to his cousin.
